# REFYN-1
Refyn is a new AI algorithm and API server

REFYN can predict, or find insights/answers in any database just by attribute of the subject, and "unknown data". No training or historical data is required!
 
For example, a car rental company can easily predict next summers jeeps rentals data. However using older AI technology they will miss the `4x4` rentals because there is not any logical connection between the visitors who searched `4x4` and jeeps.
The phrase `4x4` does not exist in the database at all! As you can see, there is a huge loss of leads opportunity for this company.
 
The REFYN module can fetch all images with a certain shape, colour, etc. without scanning pixels - Just by cognitively understanding that toilet paper has a shape of a cylinder. We have a live patented product to demonstrate with.
This project may help any other projects here that required analytics for "unknown data".
